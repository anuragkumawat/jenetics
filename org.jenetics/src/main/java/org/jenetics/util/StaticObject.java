 *
 * The following <i>pattern</i> is used for creating such static helper
 * classes&mdash;the only constructors is declared private to gain the wished
 * compile-time safety:
 * [code]
 * public final class utils extends StaticObject {
 *     private utils() {}
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * [/code]
 *
 * By convention, {@code StaticObject} names are all lower-case in this library.
